      <title>Draft Profile: Kevon Looney</title>
      <link>https://www.nba.com/hawks/features/draft-profile-kevon-looney</link>
            <description>If the Hawks take a chance on a high-risk, high-reward candidate during Thursday&#039;s draft, then a player whose name they may call is Kevon Looney of UCLA. Looney fits the bill, both in terms of the talents that the Hawks typically seek as the talents they may need to supplement their current roster. The 19-year-old is long, has shown a good touch from the outside, and can go an get a rebound in traffic. </description>

      <title>Atlanta Hawks and Danny Ferry Part Ways</title>
      <link>https://www.nba.com/hawks/news/atlanta-hawks-and-danny-ferry-part-ways</link>
            <description>ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Hawks announced today that Danny Ferry has stepped down as General Manager of the team.  The move follows an indefinite leave of absence Ferry began in August, at the request of the team.  The leave was triggered by the unauthorized release of an audio recording containing a brief portion of a lengthy conference call with team ownership and others during which Ferry repeated and paraphrased language from a third-party scouting report that contained a culturally insensitive characterization of a player.</description>

      <title>Draft Profile: Kelly Oubre</title>
      <link>https://www.nba.com/hawks/features/draft-profile-kelly-oubre</link>
            <description>One of the benefits of the swapping picks with the Brooklyn Nets, and jumping from the 29th spot to the 15th pick in the draft, is that if things fall just right -- if a couple of teams draft for need and a few others miscalculate on player evaluation -- the Atlanta Hawks could end up with a top-10 talent. At times the 15th pick has yielded incredible talents who went overlooked by teams from the lottery. Giannis Antetokounmpo (2013), Kawhi Leonard (2011), and Steve Nash (1996) highlight the list. </description>

      <link>https://www.nba.com/hawks/features/seven-teams-ahead-hawks-bovadas-2016-nba-championship-odds</link>
            <description>Bovada has already published odds to win the 2016 NBA Championship, and the Atlanta Hawks come in 8th place at 25:1. The Hawks were one of just two teams to win at least 60 games in 2014-15, earned the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference and made it to the Conference Finals.  Despite the accomplishment Bovada has listed the Cavaliers, Warriors, Thunder, Bulls, Clippers, Spurs and Rockets as teams with a more likely chance to win the whole thing next season. The Hawks went 11-6 in the regular season against teams ahead of them on the list.</description>
